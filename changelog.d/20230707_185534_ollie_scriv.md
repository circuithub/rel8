### Added

- Rel8 now has extensive support for `WITH` statements and data-modifying statements (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html#QUERIES-WITH-MODIFYING).

  This work offers a lot of new power to Rel8. One new possibility is "moving" rows between tables, for example to archive rows in one table into a log table:

  ```haskell
  import Rel8

  archive :: Statement ()
  archive = do
    deleted <- 
      delete Delete
        { from = mainTable
        , using = pure ()
        , deleteWhere = \foo -> fooId foo ==. lit 123
        , returning = Returning id
        }

    insert Insert
      { into = archiveTable
      , rows = deleted
      , onConflict = DoNothing
      , returning = NoReturninvg
      } 
  ```

  This `Statement` will compile to a single SQL statement - essentially:

  ```sql
  WITH deleted_rows (DELETE FROM main_table WHERE id = 123 RETURNING *)
  INSERT INTO archive_table SELECT * FROM deleted_rows
  ```
   
  This feature is a significant performant improvement, as it avoids an entire roundtrip.

  This change has necessitated a change to how a `SELECT` statement is ran: `select` now will now produce a `Rel8.Statement`, which you have to `run` to turn it into a Hasql `Statement`. Rel8 offers a variety of `run` functions depending on how many rows need to be returned - see the various family of `run` functions in Rel8's documentation for more.
