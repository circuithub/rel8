### Fixed

- A fix for [#168](https://github.com/circuithub/rel8/issues/168), which prevented using `catListTable` on arrays of arrays. To achieve this we had to coerce arrays of arrays to text internally, which unfortunately isn't completely transparent; you can oberve it if you write something like `listTable [listTable [10]] > listTable [listTable [9]]`: previously that would be `false`, but now it's `true`. Arrays of non-arrays are unaffected by this.

### Changed

- `TypeInformation`'s `decoder` field has changed. Instead of taking a `Hasql.Decoder`, it now takes a `Rel8.Decoder`, which itself is comprised of a `Hasql.Decoder` and an `attoparsec` `Parser`. This is necessitated by the fix for [#168](https://github.com/circuithub/rel8/issues/168); we generally decode things in PostgreSQL's binary format (using a `Hasql.Decoder`), but for nested arrays we now get things in PostgreSQL's text format (for which we need an `attoparsec` `Parser`), so must have both. Most `DBType` instances that use `mapTypeInformation` or `ParseTypeInformation`, or `DerivingVia` helpers like `ReadShow`, `JSONBEncoded`, `Enum` and `Composite` are unaffected by this change.
