### Changed

- Some changes were made to the `DBEnum` type class:

  * `Enumable` was removed as a superclass constraint. It is still used to provide the default implementation of the `DBEnum` class.
  * A new method, `enumerate`, was added to the `DBEnum` class (with the default implementation provided by `Enumable`).

  This is unlikely to break any existing `DBEnum` instances, it just allows some instances that weren't possible before (e.g., for types that are not `Generic`).
