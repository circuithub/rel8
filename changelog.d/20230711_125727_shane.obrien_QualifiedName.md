### Added

- Added the `QualifiedName` type for named PostgreSQL objects (tables, views, functions, operators, sequences, etc.) that can optionally be qualified by a schema, including an `IsString` instance.

### Changed

- The `schema` field from `TableSchema` has been removed and the name field changed from `String` to `QualifiedName`.
- `nextval`, `function` and `binaryOperator` now take a `QualifiedName` instead of a `String`.

### Fixed

- Fixes [#228](https://github.com/circuithub/rel8/issues/228) where it was impossible to call `nextval` with a qualified sequence name.
