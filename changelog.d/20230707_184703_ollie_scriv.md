### Changed

- Rel8's API regarding aggregation has changed significantly, and is now a closer match to Opaleye. 

  The previous aggregation API had `aggregate` transform a `Table` from the `Aggregate` context back into the `Expr` context:

  ```haskell
  myQuery = aggregate do
    a <- each tableA
    return $ liftF2 (,) (sum (foo a)) (countDistinct (bar a))
  ```

  This API seemed convenient, but has some significant shortcomings. The new API requires an explicit `Aggregator` be passed to `aggregate`:

  ```haskell
  myQuery = aggregate (liftA2 (,) (sumOn foo) (countDistinctOn bar)) do
    each tableA
  ```
