### Added

- `Rel8.materialize` and `Rel8.Tabulate.materialize`, which add a materialization/optimisation fence to `SELECT` statements by binding a query to a `WITH` subquery. Note that Rel8 doesn't currently add `MATERIALIZE` to this, but may in the future. ([#180](https://github.com/circuithub/rel8/pull/180))
