### Removed

- Removed support for `network-ip`. We still support `iproute`.

### Added

- Add support for prepared statements. To use prepared statements, simply use `prepare run` instead of `run` with a function that passes the parameters to your statement.

- Added new `Encoder` type with three members: `binary`, which is the Hasql binary encoder, `text` which encodes a type in PostgreSQL's text format (needed for nested arrays) and `quote`, which is the does the thing that the function we previously called `encode` does (i.e., `a -> Opaleye.PrimExpr`).

### Changed

- Several changes to `TypeInformation`:

  * Changed the `encode` field of `TypeInformation` to be `Encoder a` instead of `a -> Opaleye.PrimExpr`.

  * Moved the `delimiter` field of `Decoder` into the top level of `TypeInformation`, as it's not "decoding" specific, it's also used when "encoding".

  * Renamed the `parser` field of `Decoder` to `text`, to mirror the `text` field of the new `Encoder` type.

  All of this will break any downstream code that uses a completely custom `DBType` implementation, but anything that uses `ReadShow`, `Enum`, `Composite`, `JSONBEncoded` or `parseTypeInformation` will continue working as before (which should cover all common cases).
