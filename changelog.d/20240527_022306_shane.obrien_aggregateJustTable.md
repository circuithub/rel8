### Added

- Add `aggregateJustTable`, `aggregateJustTable` aggregator functions. These provide another way to do aggregation of `MaybeTable`s than the existing `aggregateMaybeTable` function.
- Add `aggregateLeftTable`, `aggregateLeftTable1`, `aggregateRightTable` and `aggregateRightTable1` aggregator functions. These provide another way to do aggregation of `EitherTable`s than the existing `aggregateEitherTable` function.
- Add `aggregateThisTable`, `aggregateThisTable1`, `aggregateThatTable`, `aggregateThatTable1`, `aggregateThoseTable`, `aggregateThoseTable1`, `aggregateHereTable`, `aggregateHereTable1`, `aggregateThereTable` and `aggregateThereTable1` aggregation functions. These provide another way to do aggregation of `TheseTable`s than the existing `aggregateTheseTable` function.
