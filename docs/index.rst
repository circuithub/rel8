Welcome to Rel8!
================================

Welcome to Rel8! Rel8 is a Haskell library for interacting with PostgreSQL
databases, built on top of the fantastic `Opaleye
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/opaleye>`_ library.

The main objectives of Rel8 are:

* *Conciseness*: Users using Rel8 should not need to write boiler-plate code.
  By using expressive types, we can provide sufficient information for the
  compiler to infer code whenever possible.

* *Inferrable*: Despite using a lot of type level magic, Rel8 aims to have
  excellent and predictable type inference.

* *Familiar*: writing Rel8 queries should feel like normal Haskell programming.
