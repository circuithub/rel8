-- Haskell.nix overrides. We don't put these in cabal.project, because Cabal
-- will interpret them as local packages, and try to build them when we cabal
-- build. The only reason we have to specify these is for Haskell.nix to know to
-- override these packages by fetching them rather than using Hackage.

-- Workaround a build failure until the fix mentioned in https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/370138
-- is merged to nixpkgs-unstable
