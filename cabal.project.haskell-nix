-- Haskell.nix overrides. We don't put these in cabal.project, because Cabal
-- will interpret them as local packages, and try to build them when we cabal
-- build. The only reason we have to specify these is for Haskell.nix to know to
-- override these packages by fetching them rather than using Hackage.
