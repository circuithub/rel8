    Remove `Table Expr b` constraint from `materialize` (#334)
    
    Not only is this not necessary, it can actually act as a barrier to optimisation. The reason I added it was because it seemed like a cheap way to stop someone writing `query' <- materialize query id` â€” if you return the materialized query from `materialized`, it won't work. Really we would need some sort of `runST` type trick here to do this properly, but that would be too invasive a change.

    Add `aggregate{Just,Left,Right,This,That,Those,Here,There}Table{,1}` aggregators (#333)
    
    These provide another way to do aggregation of `MaybeTable`, `EitherTable` and `TheseTable`s than the existing `aggregate{Maybe,Either,These}Table`.
